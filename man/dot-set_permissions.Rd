\title{Set directory permissions (Unix only)}
\usage{
.set_permissions(path, read_only = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Directory path.}

\item{read_only}{Logical; TRUE to make read-only, FALSE to restore.}
}
\description{
On Unix-like systems, sets the directory and its files to read-only
(mode 0555/0444) or read-write (mode 0755/0644). This is a no-op
on Windows, where these permission bits are not meaningful.
Only applied to paths under the user cache directory.
